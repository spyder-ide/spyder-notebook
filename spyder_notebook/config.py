# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. If you want to *change* the default value of a current option, you need to
#    do a MINOR update in config version, e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
# 2. If you want to *remove* options that are no longer needed in our codebase,
#    or if you want to *rename* options, then you need to do a MAJOR update in
#    version, e.g. from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
# 3. You don't need to touch this value if you're just adding a new option
